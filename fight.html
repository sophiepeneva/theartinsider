            <h2>Art World Feud! Wild and Stone's Explosive Split Rocks the Scene</h2>
            <img src="fight.jpeg" alt="Jax and Sera Arguing"> 
            <p>The art world is abuzz with gossip after a public spat between former collaborators Jasper "Jax" Wild and Seraphina "Stone." The two artists, who once seemed inseparable, were spotted having a heated exchange at the opening of the "New Visions" exhibition last night...

                According to eyewitnesses, Stone accused Wild of plagiarizing her ideas and taking credit for her work. "She was shouting at him, calling him a fraud and a thief," says one onlooker. "It was quite a scene."
                
                The feud reportedly stems from the artists' recent split after a successful collaborative partnership. Sources say that Stone has been harboring resentment towards Wild for his rising fame and critical acclaim, which she believes is partly due to her own contributions.
                
                "Sera feels betrayed and undervalued," says a close friend of Stone's. "She believes Jax has stolen her ideas and used her talent to advance his own career."
                
                Wild has yet to comment on the accusations, but the art world is eagerly awaiting his response. This public feud is sure to cast a shadow over both artists' reputations and could potentially damage their careers.</p>
