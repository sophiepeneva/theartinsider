                <p>While some hail them as a visionary artist, others decry their actions as vandalism.  Authorities are baffled, with no leads on the Phantom's identity. Is this a rebellious artist making a statement, or a clever publicity stunt?</p>

            <h2><a href="fight.html">Art World Feud! Wild and Stone's Explosive Split Rocks the Scene</a></h2> 
            <p>The art world is abuzz with gossip after a public spat between former collaborators Jasper "Jax" Wild and Seraphina "Stone." The two artists, who once seemed inseparable, were spotted having a heated exchange at the opening of the "New Visions" exhibition last night...</p>
            <div class="full-article hidden">
                <p>According to eyewitnesses, Stone accused Wild of plagiarizing her ideas and taking credit for her work. "She was shouting at him, calling him a fraud and a thief," says one onlooker. "It was quite a scene."</p>
                <p>The feud reportedly stems from the artists' recent split after a successful collaborative partnership. Sources say that Stone has been harboring resentment towards Wild for his rising fame and critical acclaim, which she believes is partly due to her own contributions.</p>
                <p>"Sera feels betrayed and undervalued," says a close friend of Stone's. "She believes Jax has stolen her ideas and used her talent to advance his own career."</p>
                <p>Wild has yet to comment on the accusations, but the art world is eagerly awaiting his response. This public feud is sure to cast a shadow over both artists' reputations and could potentially damage their careers.</p>
